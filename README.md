# defects4j-two-edit-degree-patches

This repository contains a set of 1106 test-suite adequate patches for the Defects4j benchmark (https://github.com/rjust/defects4j), generated by the extended version of the ARJA framework available at https://github.com/pdziurzanski/arja-manatee.



The patches are in the ARJA format. All of them are two-edit degree patches (i.e., altering two modification points only). The patches have not been generated for the Defects4j bugs that are plausible fixed by one-edit degree patches available at https://github.com/pdziurzanski/defects4j-one-edit-degree-patches.

For example, Patch_1028 for the Chart21 bug replaces lines 175 and 191 in file DefaultBoxAndWhiskerCategoryDataset.java, replacing them with two different seeds, extracted from the same code.

1 Replace ./bugs/chart_21/source/org/jfree/data/statistics/DefaultBoxAndWhiskerCategoryDataset.java 175\
Faulty:\
this.maximumRangeValueColumn=c;\
Seed:\
this.minimumRangeValueRow=-1;\
**************************************************\
2 Replace /mnt/lustre/users/pd678/manatee/exhaustiveDefects4j/bugs/chart_21/source/org/jfree/data/statistics/DefaultBoxAndWhiskerCategoryDataset.java 191\
Faulty:\
fireDatasetChanged();\
Seed:\
this.minimumRangeValue=minval;\
**************************************************\

As the patches in the ARJA format cannot be applied directly to the source code, they have been converted to the diff format by the Perl script available at https://github.com/pdziurzanski/arja2diff-patch-converter. That repository also includes the converted versions of these patches.
